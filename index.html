								<p>
									Student research has determined that existing Meteorological
									stations, in our pilot city, Barcelona, are not providing real
									time air quality status for schools in their immediate area.
									Sensors are primarily in green public parks and on high spots
									of the city such as radio towers and at the top of hills. It
									was determined that there is an urgent need for schools to
									monitor the air quality of their particular locale – so that
									they may take protective actions as necessary.
								</p>
							</div>
							<div class="col-4 col-12-medium">
								<p>
									To ensure the health of our young students and provide an
									opportunity for a meaningful technical project, Alella Green
									Tech is sponsoring the schoolAIR project: students will use
									the latest microcontrollers and various different types of
									sensors, to build an air quality and weather station from
									scratch. This will give students an excellent foundation in
									environmental science, data science, electronics and
									programming. Air & Weather stations will be installed at each
									participating school.

						<h2>Project Components</h2>

					<p>
						Our team has meticulously researched and selected components to
						create a system that is both powerful and economical. By using
						modern, high-quality, yet affordable microcontrollers and sensors,
						we've designed a modular and extensible station. The overall cost
						has been kept remarkably low, making this vital technology
						accessible and affordable for most schools, maximizing the benefits
						for students everywhere.

						<h2>Students of Different Ages Working Together</h2>
					</header>
					<p>
						Over June and July of 2025, students from representative schools
						started on the project by researching the need for monitoring air
						quality in schools - using Barcelona as the first location - and
						designing the overall system. Our first team of young data science
						pioneers was made up of students of ages 12 through 24 – all
						collaborating to build the system together. We found that the older
						students enjoyed explaining the thornier concepts to the younger
						ones and the team pulled through very well together and completed
						the challenging project.

						<h2>A Global Project with a Big Vision</h2>
					</header>
					<h3>Global School Participation</h3>
					<p>
						Complete air quality and weather station kits, along with all the
						necessary open-source software and documentation, will be made
						available to participating schools. The schoolAir project will also
						provide the core infrastructure, including server and database
						access, so that schools can easily build a system that facilitates
						monitoring and trend analysis. Extensive climate and air quality
						data will be downloadable from the central schoolAIR.org website.
					</p>
					<p>
						The schoolAIR.org website will allow schools to easily join the
						project and request the necessary materials and plans. Participating
						schools will be able to visit the parameter information page for
						their campus, while all public data will be anonymized to protect
						privacy. Global data across all schools or selected areas will be
						shown as aggregated trends only. The idea is to give everyone the
						tools to identify the general areas where air quality improvement is
						necessary to keep our children healthy and performing at their best.
					</p>

					<h3 style="margin-top: 2em">Beyond Monitoring</h3>
					<p>
						Beyond monitoring the outside area for pollutants and the inside
						areas for the right composition of the air children breathe, we are
						investigating partnerships with corporate entities that provide
						products that improve air quality in closed spaces. It is a well
						known fact that an excess of CO2 in a closed room causes lower
						cognitive performance and focus. As schools identify zones where air
						quality can be improved, the schoolAIR.org project will seek to
						provide guidelines for improvement as well as identifying companies
						and products that specifically improve air quality – but simply
						being prompted to open a window would be a great first step
						forwards!

						<h2>A growing schoolAIR Community</h2>
						<p>
							The schoolAIR.org team is proud that our first pioneering students
							have already put together the system and will be working as
							ambassadors and technical liaison in the first pilot schools. As
							more schools take up the project, a community of technically able
							and very motivated students will form.
						</p>
						<p>
							The non-profit schoolAIR.org project will go live at its first
							school in September. Interested schools and individuals can
							request more information at the project website or write to
							info@schoolAIR.org
